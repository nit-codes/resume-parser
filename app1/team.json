The scope of the project was to study the usage of the three applications through market visits and secondary data. Proposed Solutions: 1. Real Time Transaction Update: The Vodafone Connect application used by retailers did not get a real time transaction update whereas the competition applications had real time update. 2. Incentive Transfer to Other Vodafone Sim: Since the incentive to retailer was being given on a SIM that wasnt being used by the retailer, but could also not be handed over to a family member given the business requirements, transferring the incentive to a family members SIM made the incentive lucrative again. 3. Smartphone Holder Since one reason cited to not hand smartphone over to customer by retailer was safety and security concern, smartphone holder could be used that competition used in certain areas of rural India. 4. Incentive Dashboard: To tackle improper and incoherent communication related to incentives that was otherwise in a verbal/informal format, use a dashboard on V Connect application to drive usage of application. 5. 100% Cashback through Retailer Recharges: Retailers will get incentives if they make recharges through V Connect application and customers will get 100% cashbacks through the retailer recharges. 6. Ninja Incentive Dashboard: A simple dashboard on m power for DSEs to see where they stand on their incentives as per Sherdil scheme and/or other incentive schemes 7. Vodafone Sales Academy: Provide training modules for the use of various options on m power and how they are to be implemented in the market. Keep regular tests and minimum cutoffs for the same.

To contribute in smart work we are going to design a cost effective solution in distribution transformer, to protect it from thermal overload. In India the maximum distribution transformer is damaged due to short circuit current, but still there is no any smart protection is applied for it due to its high cost. One other advantage of newly designed short circuit current limiting transformer is it having inbuilt in distribution transformer. Every distribution transformer having star connected secondary winding. As concentrate on that neutral point we design iron core gap movable to magnetic flux by pass that effect on secondary winding induced current that the current limiting used for avoid transformer damage.

The scope of the project was to study the usage of the three applications through market visits and secondary data. Proposed Solutions: 1. Real Time Transaction Update: The Vodafone Connect application used by retailers did not get a real time transaction update whereas the competition applications had real time update. 2. Incentive Transfer to Other Vodafone Sim: Since the incentive to retailer was being given on a SIM that wasnt being used by the retailer, but could also not be handed over to a family member given the business requirements, transferring the incentive to a family members SIM made the incentive lucrative again. 3. Smartphone Holder Since one reason cited to not hand smartphone over to customer by retailer was safety and security concern, smartphone holder could be used that competition used in certain areas of rural India. 4. Incentive Dashboard: To tackle improper and incoherent communication related to incentives that was otherwise in a verbal/informal format, use a dashboard on V Connect application to drive usage of application. 5. 100% Cashback through Retailer Recharges: Retailers will get incentives if they make recharges through V Connect application and customers will get 100% cashbacks through the retailer recharges. 6. Ninja Incentive Dashboard: A simple dashboard on m power for DSEs to see where they stand on their incentives as per Sherdil scheme and/or other incentive schemes 7.
